# Royal Runaway Website Design - README

Welcome to the Royal Runaway website design! A month in the making but i got it done alot of issues but somehow i worked through them.

# Directory for Website Plans

The website plans or blueprints can be found in the following directory: /img/website plans

# JavaScript

The menu and cart have been implemented using JavaScript. Theres also a few smaller things that have been done.

# Products Injected via Local Storage and ProductDB

The products are injected into the website using local storage and a product database.

# Bootstrap

I used a mix of html and Bootstrap i didnt like it when we started out but its very usefull in some instances.

# CSS Structure

The CSS structure is a bit all over the place, and I apologize for that. Coding is still new to me, and I will learn over time how to restructure everything code-wise.

I hope you enjoy the website! It was a month of pure stress putting all of this together. Thank you for visiting Royal Runaway.
